# The Remaining of Us

Zombie-shooter 2D survival game written in C++ using SFML library.

## Important
For now, the game can crash from time to time during start-up due to
the sound assets being loaded in a parallel thread using promise library
which does not always comply with SFML's sound buffer objects.

## Brief description of gameplay
You are the last man standing between your bunker and countless dead.
Strafe, shoot, reload and slay zombies for as long as you can!

## Installation
Just download the TheRemainingOfUs.rar and simply unrar the package and run the .exe file.

## Assets
All the used graphics were created by me in MS Paint on maximum zoom
to achieve a sweet pixel-art style.
